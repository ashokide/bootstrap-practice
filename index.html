                India, officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[23] is a country in South Asia. It is
                the second-most populous country, the seventh-largest country by land area, and the most populous
                democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and
                the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[f] China, Nepal,
                and Bhutan to the north;

                Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[24] Their
                long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly
                diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[25] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent
                in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus
                Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.

                The term Bharat (Bhārat; pronounced [ˈbʱaːɾət] (About this soundlisten)), mentioned in both Indian epic
                poetry and the Constitution of India,[64][65] is used in its variations by many Indian languages. A
                modern rendering of the historical name Bharatavarsha, which applied originally to northern
                India,[66][67] Bharat gained increased currency from the mid-19th century as a native name for
                India.[64][68]

                Hindustan ([ɦɪndʊˈstaːn] (About this soundlisten)) is a Middle Persian name for India, introduced during
                the Mughal Empire and used widely since. Its meaning has varied, referring to a region encompassing
                present-day northern India and Pakistan or to India in its near entirety.[64][68][69]

                Indian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years.[359] During the Vedic period (c. 1700 BCE – c. 500
                BCE), the foundations of Hindu philosophy, mythology, theology and literature were laid, and many
                beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as dhárma, kárma, yóga, and mokṣa, were
                established.[63] India is notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam,
                Christianity, and Jainism among the nation's major religions.[360] The predominant religion, Hinduism,
                has been shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of the Upanishads,[361] the
                Yoga Sutras, the Bhakti movement,[360] and by Buddhist philosophy.[362]
